   <p class="mb-4">By the time Demon Days dropped in 2005, Gorillaz weren’t just a band — they were a full-blown universe. And the album’s cover? A perfect snapshot of that world. Designed by artist and Gorillaz co-creator Jamie Hewlett, the artwork features the animated band members — 2D, Murdoc, Noodle, and Russel — in moody, profile-style squares. It’s a clear nod to The Beatles’ Let It Be cover, but here it’s darker, edgier, and dripping with dystopian cool. Each character is turned slightly away, each face holding a different story, hinting at the emotional weight and gritty commentary packed into the music. What makes this cover so effective is its simplicity. Four blocks, four characters, one deep vibe. It tells you everything without saying a word — and perfectly sets the tone for the album’s blend of hip-hop, melancholy, and post-millennial unease. Demon Days is one of those rare records where the visuals don’t just match the music — they expand it. Like a graphic novel in album form.</p>
